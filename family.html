  <h2>Mercado-Rizal Family</h2>
  <p>The Mercado-Rizal family was one of the most influential and respected families in Calamba, Laguna during the Spanish colonial period. The surname 'Mercado' was adopted by Jose Rizal's great-grandfather, Domingo Lam-co, a Chinese immigrant, to symbolize their trade (market) profession. Later, Jose's father, Francisco, adopted the additional surname 'Rizal' to comply with a Spanish decree on surnames and to avoid confusion with other Mercados.</p>
